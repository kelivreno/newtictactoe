## New Tic Tac Toe

A simple Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. i have no idea what was wrong with my previous code, but anyway, I'm building a new tic tac toe game. 

# Files
`'index.html'`  - The main HTML file that contains the structure of the game board.
<br> `style.css`     - The CSS file that contains the styles for the game board.
<br> `'script.js`    - The JavaScript file that contains the logic for the game.

# How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Open the index.html file in your browser to start the game.

# Gameplay
1. The game starts with "X" taking the first turn.
2. Click on any of the cells to place your symbol (X or O).
3. The game alternates between X and O until either one player gets three in a row  
   or all cells are filled.
